## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a matrix and cache's its inverse.


## The first function, makeVector creates a special "vector", which is really a list containing a function to

## set the value of the matrix
## get the value of the matrix
## set the value of the inverse
## get the value of the inverse



makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
    m <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
      x <<- y
      m <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() m
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
  }




## The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" created with the above function. 
## However, it first checks to see if the mean has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, 
## it calculates the mean of the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'

    m <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(m)
    m
  }
